# Offline ingredient seasons and after-opening guidance

The release catalog now includes a versioned, reviewed lifecycle sidecar:
`custom_components/cook4me/catalog/ingredient_lifecycle.v1.json`.
It is read once during the existing catalog executor warmup. No network, AI,
cloud credentials, or per-scan file reads are needed.

## Reviewed coverage (2026-09-24.2)

- 64 produce groups, including fruit, leafy vegetables, roots, asparagus,
  tomatoes, cultivated button mushrooms, potatoes and new potatoes.
- Ten numeric after-opening groups: pasteurized/UHT milk, low-acid canned
  foods, high-acid canned foods, Alpro plant drinks and cream/yoghurt alternatives,
  oat drinks (Alpro or Oatly), Taifun plain and silken tofu, and Reishunger
  smoked tofu and coconut milk. Brand and handling conditions remain attached.
- Explicit label-required guidance for reviewed foods with variable product
  formulations, including pesto, dairy yoghurt, cream cheese and coconut cream.
- Dry staples have no invented short spoilage countdown. Their package
  instructions still apply; missing data never means indefinitely safe.

Run `python tools/audit_ingredient_lifecycle.py` for counts against the actual
shipped catalog. Counts distinguish seasonal, numeric and label-required
entries. Coverage is explicitly incomplete; unmapped ingredients remain unknown.

## Season semantics

Season months are German availability guidance from the twelve monthly
calendars published by the Hessische Lehrkräfteakademie and the BZfE potato guide.
For calendar entries, the source region
(`DE-HE`), country (`DE`), source links and review date are preserved. The source
includes stored produce and protected cultivation; these months must not be
labelled as exclusively fresh outdoor harvest. Ordinary potatoes have year-round
availability, including stored crops, according to BZfE (`sourceRegion: DE`).
New potatoes have a separate June/July highlight profile; they do not inherit
the stored-potato calendar. Sweet potatoes and potato starch remain separate.

The calendars list monthly highlights rather than every crop. A listed month
returns `in_season`, twelve listed months return `year_round`, and an omitted
month returns `unknown`. Unsupported countries also return `unknown`. A Greek
UI does not imply Greek growing seasons. These are approximate shopping/planning
hints and do not prohibit using stored or imported food.

Only exact reviewed canonical names/forms receive a profile during loading.
The allowlist includes reviewed raw cutting/washing variants. Preserved,
frozen, cooked, dried or alternative/ambiguous forms do not inherit fresh
profiles through a substring, display synonym, translation or semantic sibling.
An ingredient's provider IDs, nutrition and dietary evidence are preserved.

## Opening-window semantics

`afterOpening.rules` contains `daysMin`, `daysMax`, refrigerator temperature,
handling conditions, source IDs and, where required, brand. Numeric evidence is
general or manufacturer guidance, never a guaranteed spoilage/safety threshold.
The conservative refrigerator cap for general and tofu guidance is 4 °C;
Alpro's published maximum is 7 °C. The corresponding refrigeration sources are
included with each rule.

Oat drinks retain separate Alpro (5 days) and Oatly (5–7 days) rules. The Oatly
rule also requires confirmation that the package was promptly reclosed and its
opening was not touched or drunk from. Reishunger smoked tofu requires a closed
container (2 days); its coconut milk uses the published 2–3 day range. These
manufacturer rules are not applied to other brands, dairy products, other tofu
forms or coconut cream. The coconut milk source also states a 3-day maximum in
its product storage instructions, consistent with the range's upper end.

The date helper accepts existing lot fields `openedAt`, `bestBefore`,
`useWithinDays`, `noExpiry`, `storage` and `brand`:

1. No opening date means no countdown.
2. A package-specific `useWithinDays` wins over generic catalog guidance.
3. Otherwise the catalog rule must match the known brand, refrigerator storage,
   supplied temperature and confirmed handling/food-form conditions.
4. Consumption can start immediately on opening. For a 3–4 day range,
   `remindOn` is opening + 3 days and `consumeBy` is opening + 4 days. This is
   not an instruction to wait three days before eating.
5. An earlier printed date caps both calculated dates. The original printed
   date is never rewritten. A printed date before opening is explicitly flagged.
6. `noExpiry` suppresses the printed date only; it does not cancel a known
   after-opening interval. Frozen storage is not assigned a refrigerator rule.

The result has `safetyGuarantee: false`. Bad dates, fractions, boolean intervals
and calendar overflow are rejected. Unknown rules return no invented deadline.
The helper never mutates inventory or marks a package opened.

## Runtime surfaces

Catalog ingredient rows, display choices (including the scanner catalog) and
recipe ingredient rows carry compact `lifecycle` metadata. A grouped display
choice carries only its selected exact ingredient's evidence, not siblings'.

Public functions in `release_catalog.py`:

- `ingredient_lifecycle_profile(ingredient, include_sources=True)`
- `ingredient_seasonal_availability(ingredient, country=..., month=...)`
- `ingredient_opening_window(ingredient, lot, temperature_c=..., confirmed_conditions=...)`

These resolve by exact ID/key. Sending only a display name does not select
evidence. Returned metadata is independently copied, so UI edits cannot corrupt
the cached catalog.

This is a catalog/backend enrichment. It supplies metadata and calculations for
consumers; it does not add UI controls, silently apply catalog intervals to
existing packages, change weekly-plan ranking or replace existing reminders.

## Verification

`python tests/test_ingredient_lifecycle.py` covers evidence validation, country
and month boundaries, unknown/preserved forms, package precedence, brand and
temperature gates, leap years, earlier printed dates, unopened packages, exact
identity, recipe/picker propagation, and copy isolation. The existing Validate
workflow runs it and audits the actual release catalog on Python 3.13.
